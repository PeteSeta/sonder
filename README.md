**sonder is an anonymous, safe, and inclusive place for you to speak your mind.**

on sonder, you share thoughts— a few words, a sentence or two, or when you need it, a few paragraphs.

it can be about anything; a part of your day, some encouraging words for a stranger— or a confession nobody can know.

sonder is anonymous— you don't have to login or register in any way to use sonder. we don't know who you are, nor do we collect or store that information.

## Technical

**tech stack** | _the FERN stack_

- client: _Next.js, TailwindCSS_
- server: _Node, Express, Firebase_

> why Next.js?

Next.js adds SSR (server side rendering) to vanilla React. React is used to make _sonder_ interactive and not just another static website. It's modern and powerful, and with Next.js, no longer bloated. _sonder_ runs beautifully on mobile devices as well as desktop devices.
